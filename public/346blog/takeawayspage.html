    <h2>Takeaways: Python and JavaScript</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, while both Python and JavaScript have their strengths and unique features, if I were to be developing a dynamic visual application, I would use JavaScript.</p>
    <p>However, when it comes to data science and big data analysis, I would absolutely use Python and its library Pandas.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, most languages are capable of doing most things a programmer might want to do and it comes down to personal preference and what language is best suited for your existing skillset. Personally, I'm not great with tkinter, and therefore I don't often have a desire to work on GUIs in Python. I could much better spend my time and effort on a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
