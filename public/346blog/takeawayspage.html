    <h2>Takeaways: Python and JavaScript</h2>
    <p>In conclusion, while both Python and JavaScript have their strengths and unique features, if I were to be developing a dynamic visual application, I would use JavaScript.</p>
    <p>However, when it comes to data science and big data analysis, I would absolutely use Python and its library Pandas.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, most languages are capable of doing most things a programmer might want to do and it comes down to personal preference and what language is best suited for your existing skillset. Personally, I'm not great with tkinter, and therefore I don't often have a desire to work on GUIs in Python. I could much better spend my time and effort on a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h2>Language Ecosystem Considerations</h2>
    <p>When it comes to choosing between Python and JavaScript and which language to learn, JavaScript and Python are both so common and prominent that you can trust that you'll be able to find a job just about anywhere if you know one or the other, certainly if you know both of them.</p>
    <p>According to data from <a href="https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2020/4">GitHut</a>, the two most common languages for activity (defined as pull requests, pushes, stars, and issues) on GitHub are JavaScript and Python.</p>
    <p>One consideration I think is worth making is that Python is famously <a href="https://www.python.org/about/#:~:text=Python%20is%20developed%20under%20an,by%20the%20Python%20Software%20Foundation.">open-source</a>, even for commercial use. Because of this, <a href="https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/open-source-python-libraries/#:~:text=There%20are%20over%20137%2C000%20python,data%20manipulation%20applications%20and%20more.">there are over 130,000</a> libraries available in Python. If you can't find a library for what you need, you're 100% allowed to write your own and distribute it!</p>
