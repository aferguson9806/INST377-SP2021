    <h2>JavaScript: Features, and Strengths</h2>

    <p>Unlike Python, I think JavaScript is less familiar to most UMD iSchool Students. JavaScript is taught in INST377, Dynamic Web Applications, but otherwise is not commonly expected to be known in the Information Science Major.</p>
    <p>Contrary to what most people think when reading the name of this programming language, JavaScript is not related to Java. JavaScript was written by the company that created Netscape, a prominent web browser in the 1990s. Meanwhile, Java was created by Sun MicroSystems, and is used for back-end data management and large-scale applications.</p>
    
    <h3>JavaScript Web Integration</h3>
    
    <p>JavaScript, on the other hand, is the backbone of dynamic web applications. JavaScript was written with HTML and CSS in mind. JavaScript allows web developers to add more functionality to their websites than just simple markup and styling.</p>
    <p>For example, <a href="../labs/lab_3/index.html">here</a> is something I wrote in JavaScript for INST377. This is an image carousel that cycles through images stored within the website's source files. Notice how I didn't have to include a screenshot of this project? This highlights one of JavaScript's greatest strength, one that I will talk more about on the next page. That is, JavaScript is seamlessly integrated into the web with a simple "script" tag in your HTML.</script></p>
    <p>This is where I believe JavaScript thrives. The language is great at adding functionality to HTML/CSS and adds life to the web.</p>

    <h3>JavaScript Explicit Code Block Syntax</h3>

    <p>A huge difference between Python and JavaScript, and the feature that threw me off the most when learning this language, is that JavaScript uses explicit code block syntax. When you write compound statements in JavaScript, like conditional statements or functions, the contents of the compound statement are held within brackets, rather than indentation levels.</p>
    <p>Pictured below is an example of this explicit syntax from some code I wrote.</p>
    <div class="images">
        <img src="images/jsbrackets.png" alt="Brackets in JavaScript Code">
    </div>
    <p>This code snippet is a function called "jump." Everything that occurs when the function is called is contained within the orange brackets. In this case, a conditional is checked, and a variable is reassigned.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3>JavaScript Asynchronous Functions</h3>

    <p>One final difference between Python and JavaScript is that in JS, some functions can be classified as "asynchronous." This means that the process can occur and before it ends, another process can begin. This is extremely useful for things like games. So many things have to happen simultaneously to make most modern games work, and if there was no or limited capability for asynchronous fuinctions, it would be very difficult to make them work at a large scale.</p>
