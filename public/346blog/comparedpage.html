    <h2>Python and JavaScript: GUI Capabilites Compared</h2>
    <p>When it comes to scripting for the purpose of displaying information visually on a computer, I think there are clear advantages and disadvantages to both Python and JavaScript. However, in my experience, I would say that if I needed to quickly prepare a dynamic GUI that allows me to interact with a script using a visual interface, I would reach for JavaScript 9 out of 10 times.</p>
    <p>JavaScript's integration into HTML (which isn't even really a programming language, just English markup) makes it very easy to create basic programs that have visual displays. For example, linked <a href="../flappy/index.html">here</a> is an example of a copy-cat version of the popular mobile game "flappy bird" I made using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for my INST377 course. Just press space to make the bird jump!</p>
    <p>Thinking back on my Python tkinter project "colors.io," that project took me a long time to write, required an extensive knowledge of Object Oriented Programming, required me to learn a new library (tkinter) which is often unintuitive and not very consistent in its ruleset, and was very frustrating. Flappy Bird on the other hand, took me about an hour while following a basic JavaScript tutorial.</p>

    <p>I think that given JavaScript's seamless integration into HTML and CSS, it is so much easier to create graphical programs using it than Python. For example, <a href="https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/11/slack-browser-view-3/#:~:text=Slack%20is%20written%20in%20Electron,as%20the%20team%20would%20like.">Slack</a>, a popular chat system for large companies and organizations, was made using JavaScript. Specifically, "Electron," which is a framework for writing desktop apps using web baseed systems like Node.js, Chrome's JavaScript engine.</p>
